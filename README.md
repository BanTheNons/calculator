# Calculator!

A Discord calculator written in typescript (Cloudfare workers are amazing). This application doesn't actually require a bot user! All you have to do to get this working is create a Discord Application, get your client credentials token with the `applications.commands.update` scope and create a slash command (The name doesn't matter). Then, you can rename src/constants.example.ts to constants.ts and put your public key in there. After that, you should be good to go! Make sure to add your application to a server with only the `applications.commands` scope, if you put `bot` in there it's going to give you an error.
